    	<p><strong>Dakshana Foundation</strong> - Infinite good
        <br>I have been a student of DAKSHANA FOUNDATION.
           <br>It is basically a NGO that helps bright and impoverished students predominantly 
           from rural India to prepare for IIT and medical entrance exams for free of cost.
           <br>I was enrolled there (Dakshana Bangalore Centre) in Two year programme for my JEE preparation.
           Dakshana operates from Irvine, California and Pune in India. 
           <br>Those two year were the best part of my life as I have had some of the best days of my life.
           It's been almost two years I left Dakshana but I feel like yesterday only I came out of this heaven.

      <p><strong>Navodaya</strong> - A Home away from home.
<br> Jawahar Navodaya Vidhyalayas(JNV) are residential schools from 5th to 12th all over the country,
 where students do not just study, they play together ,eat together ,make friends for life and grow together.
I studied in Navodaya from my 5th to 10th only as I got selected in Dakshana Foundation in 11th. But I was part of JNV Bangalore in my 11th and 12th.
<br> For a Navodayan JNV isn't just a school but a lot more than that.
We cry the day we enter in the campus full of strangers and surely we cry the day we leave after 12th(+2).
And after that for me at least it is not a schools it is a feeling, a bundle of emotions,and a family with whom I lived for five years.

      <p><strong>IIT Bombay</strong>
<br>No intro is required I guess :\
<br>For me, It is an undreamt college. 
Those who do not know, IIT BOMBAY is the best technological institute in India.
Speaking in terms of finance, I could not ever imagine to get in this premeire institute until Dakshana Foundation opened gate for me.
It does really require a lot of hard work, not hardly but which requires coaching ,for that we need money and in my case it's a lot of money.
Anyhow i'm there now, feeling kinda satisfied and happy.
<br>But as they say every thing is not just that perfect,likewise here in IIT which holds so called the sharpest minds of the country 
I see a lots of confessions about lives of students which tells us it isn't that great what it seems from outside.
Well everyone's life is different, and everyone wants the same in different ways, perhaps that is what makes them feel not so good even being in the best.
Honestly for me , IIT Bom-bae is just the best and I'm happy here.
