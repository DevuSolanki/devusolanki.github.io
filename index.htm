    	<p>I have been a student of DAKSHANA FOUNDATION.
           <br>DAKSHANA FOUNDATION is basically a NGO that helps bright and impoverished students predominantly 
           from rural India to prepare for IIT and medical entrance exams for free of cost.
           <br>I was enrolled there (Dakshana Bangalore Centre) in Two year programme for my JEE preparation.
           Dakshana operates from Irvine, California and Pune in India. 
           <br>Those two year were the best part of my life as I have had some of the best days of my life.
           It's been almost two years I left Dakshana but I feel like yesterday only I came out of this heaven.

      <p>Navodaya- A Home away from home.
<br> Jawahar Navodaya Vidhyalayas(JNV) are residential schools from 5th to 12th all over the country,
 where students do not just study, they play together ,eat together ,make friends for life and grow together.
I studied in Navodaya from my 5th to 10th only as I got selected in Dakshana Foundation in 11th.
<br> For a Navodayan JNV isn't just a school but a lot more than that.
We cry the day we enter in the campus full of strangers and surely we cry the day we leave after 12th(+2).
And after that for me at least it is not a schools it is a feeling, a bundle of emotions,and a family with whom I lived for five years.

Apart from this I like to watch movies and web series, Skating-a below average skater:), and playing Guitar- I don't have one:(.
Here I post blogs reg. the Institutions I have been in and my experience there, and any of the spectacular thing I have been part of or experienced.
